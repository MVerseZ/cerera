Cerera network.
Version 1.
(Cerera Blockchain network v.1)
________________________________________________
Abstract
There are many types of blockchains with different integrations. 
Most of them are EVM-compatible.
Pioneer of all - bitcoin network.
Cerera network - simple transaction PoW chain with limited inner coin.

Cerera provides secure storage for user accounts, stored off chain.
There are block with transactions (or empty) with on-chain data. It open and anybody can only-read it.

As the any blockchain project there is RPC communication protocol via HTTP(S).

There is no any VM for virtual contracts creation. But transaction entity can store big data, like CSV dataframes or multimedia content.

________________________________________________
Consensus algorythm
Based on Raft with some mods.

Example for nodes (A[100]), (B[0])

A <------------> B
A <---B--join--- B
A ----Latest---> B
A <---B--sync--- B[100]
A ----[100]----> B
A <---B--done--- B

Now A[100+N], B[100] (N - count waiting for consensus)

Example for nodes (A[1], B[10], C[100], D[10], E[42], F[0], G[5000])
Where D and G node are compromated by hjacking


Example:

New node connect to gossip and send ID + public key
Swarm of consensus add new node to KNOWN NODES
Move to consensus
>>>>>
What if KNOWN NODE has height 1000, new node is 0. Consensus of new node has been started from 1001 height?
Or there is a sync process making new node to height 1000. Before it will be KNOWN NODE 2.

Or there is a Consensus knowledge and operation borrowing.
We have 1 node. Consenus.
We have 1 node and 1 diff node. Consenus work.
We have 2 nodes. Consenus.
